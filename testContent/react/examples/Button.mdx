## Examples

### Variant examples

PatternFly supports several button styling variants to be used in different scenarios as needed. The following button variants can be assigned using the `variant` property.


import ButtonVariations from "./ButtonVariations.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonVariations} />

| Variant | Description|
| --- | ---|
| Primary | Primary buttons are the most visually prominent variant. Use for the most important call to action.|
| Secondary | Secondary buttons are less visually prominant than primary buttons. Use for general actions on a page that require less emphasis than primary buttons. |
| Tertiary | Tertiary buttons are the least visually prominent variant. Use to retain a classic button format with less emphasis than primary or secondary buttons.  |
| Danger | Danger buttons may be used for actions that are potentially destructive or difficult/impossible to undo. Danger is an independent variant, but all button variants may use the the `isDanger` property to apply similar styling. |
| Warning | Warning buttons may be used for actions that change an important setting or behavior, but not in a destructive or irreversible way. |
| Link | Links are labeled, but have no background or border. Use for actions that require less emphasis, actions that navigate users to another page within the same window, and/or actions that navigate to external pages in a new window. Links may be placed inline with text using the `isInline` property.|
| Plain | Plain buttons have no styling and are intended to be labeled with icons. |
| Control | Control buttons can be labeled with text or icons. Primarily intended to be paired with other controls in an [input group](/components/input-group). |
| Stateful | Stateful buttons are ideal for displaying the state of notifications. They have 3 states: `read`, `unread` and `attention`.

### Disabled buttons

To indicate that an action is currently unavailable, all button variations can be disabled using the `isDisabled` property.


import ButtonDisabled from "./ButtonDisabled.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonDisabled} />

### Small buttons

To fit into tight spaces, primary, secondary, tertiary, danger, and warning button variations can be made smaller using the `"sm"` value for the `size` property.


import ButtonSmall from "./ButtonSmall.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonSmall} />

### Call to action (CTA) buttons

CTA buttons and links direct users to complete an action. Primary, secondary, tertiary, and link button variants can be styled as CTAs using the `"lg"` value for the `size` property. 


import ButtonCallToAction from "./ButtonCallToAction.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonCallToAction} />

### Block level buttons

Block level buttons span the full width of the parent element and can be enabled using the `isBlock` property.


import ButtonBlock from "./ButtonBlock.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonBlock} />

### Progress indicators

Progress indicators can be added to buttons to identify that an action is in progress after a click. 


import ButtonProgress from "./ButtonProgress.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonProgress} />

### Links as buttons

Buttons that link to another resource may take the form of primary, secondary, tertiary, or link variants. Use `component="a"` and an `href` property to designate the button's target link.


import ButtonLinks from "./ButtonLinks.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonLinks} />

### Inline link as span

Inline links should use `component="span"` and the `isInline` property to wrap inline with surrounding text.


import ButtonInlineSpanLink from "./ButtonInlineSpanLink.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonInlineSpanLink} />

### Custom component

In addition to being able to pass a string to the `component` property, you can provide more fine-tuned customization by passing a callback that returns a component.


import ButtonCustomComponent from "./ButtonCustomComponent.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonCustomComponent} />

### Aria-disabled examples

[Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) is a set of roles and attributes specified by the World Wide Web Consortium. ARIA defines ways to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities.

Buttons that are aria-disabled are similar to normal disabled buttons, except they can receive focus. Every button variant can be aria-disabled using the `isAriaDisabled` property.

Unlike normal disabled buttons, aria-disabled buttons can support tooltips. Furthermore, aria-disabled buttons can operate as links, which also support tooltips.


import ButtonAriaDisabled from "./ButtonAriaDisabled.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonAriaDisabled} />

### Button with count

Buttons can display a `count` in the form of a badge to indicate some value or number by passing in the `countOptions` prop as a `BadgeCountObject` object. The `BadgeCountObject` object will handle `count`, `isRead`, and `className` props for the badge count.


import ButtonWithCount from "./ButtonWithCount.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonWithCount} />

### Plain with no padding

To display a plain/icon button inline with text, use `noPadding` prop in addition to `variant="plain"`.


import ButtonPlainHasNoPadding from "./ButtonPlainHasNoPadding.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonPlainHasNoPadding} />

### Stateful

Stateful buttons are ideal for displaying the state of notifications. Use `variant="stateful"` alongside with the `state` property, which can have these 3 values: `read`, `unread` (used as default) and `attention` (which means unread and requires attention).


import ButtonStateful from "./ButtonStateful.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={ButtonStateful} />

## Using router links

Router links can be used for in-app linking in React environments to prevent page reloading. To use a `Link` component from a router package, you can follow our [custom component example](#custom-component) and pass a callback to the `component` property of the `Button`:

```
<Button variant="link" component={(props: any) => <Link {...props} to="#" />}>
  Router link
</Button>
```
