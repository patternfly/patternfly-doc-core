## Examples

`Dropdown` builds off of the Menu component suite to wrap commonly used properties and functions for a dropdown menu. See the [Menu documentation](/components/menus/menu) for a full list of properties that may be passed through `Dropdown` to further customize the dropdown menu, or the [custom menu examples](/components/menus/custom-menus) for additional examples of fully functional menus.

### Basic dropdowns

Basic dropdowns present users with a menu of items upon clicking a dropdown toggle.

A `<Dropdown>` uses a [menu toggle](/components/menus/menu-toggle), which is passed to the `toggle` property, as well as a `<DropdownList>` with multiple `<DropdownItem>` components. To allow a dropdown to change the open state of the menu, pass the `isOpen` property into the `onOpenChange` callback.

The following example shows a few different states of dropdown items. As shown in this example, dropdown items may:

- Use the `isDisabled` property to disable an item.
- Use the `onClick` property to trigger a callback for an action.

This example also uses a `<Divider>` which passes in `key=”separator”` to split the menu into 2 sections with a horizontal line.


import DropdownBasic from "./DropdownBasic.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={DropdownBasic} />

### With kebab toggle

To style a dropdown menu's toggle with a kebab icon, pass a "plain" `<MenuToggle>` to the `toggle` property. When there isn't enough space for a labeled button, a kebab icon can be used to toggle the dropdown menu open or closed.


import DropdownWithKebabToggle from "./DropdownWithKebabToggle.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={DropdownWithKebabToggle} />

### With groups of items

To group sets of related dropdown items together, use a `<DropdownGroup>`. When more than 1 `<DropdownGroup>` is created in a menu, use the `label` and `labelHeadingLevel` properties to assign a name and heading level to each group.


import DropdownWithGroups from "./DropdownWithGroups.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={DropdownWithGroups} />

### With item descriptions

To provide users with more context about a `<DropdownItem>`, pass a short message to `description` property. As shown in the example below, an item's description will appear below its label.


import DropdownWithDescriptions from "./DropdownWithDescriptions.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={DropdownWithDescriptions} />
