## Examples

### Basic with title


import HintBasicWithTitle from "./HintBasicWithTitle.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={HintBasicWithTitle} />

### Basic without title


import HintBasicWithoutTitle from "./HintBasicWithoutTitle.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={HintBasicWithoutTitle} />

### With actions

You can add actions to a hint to allow users to respond to suggestions and initiate any related processes.

When a `<Hint>` contains `actions`, a negative margin is applied to the actions so that they are better aligned with the hint title. For larger-sized titles or non-plain actions (such as a button), remove this negative margin by setting `hasNoActionsOffset` to `true`.

To illustrate this behavior, select the "actions hasNoActionsOffset" checkbox in the following example.


import HintActionsWithNoOffset from "./HintActionsWithNoOffset.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={HintActionsWithNoOffset} />
