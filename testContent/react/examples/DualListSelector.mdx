## Examples

The dual list selector is built in a composable manner to make customization easier. The standard sub-component relationships are arranged as follows:

```
<DualListSelector>
  <DualListSelectorPane>
    <DualListSelectorList>
      <DualListSelectorListItem />
    </DualListSelectorList>
  </DualListSelectorPane>

  <DualListSelectorControlsWrapper>
    <DualListSelectorControl /> /* A standard Dual list selector has 4 controls */
  </DualListSelectorControlsWrapper>

  <DualListSelectorPane isChosen>
    <DualListSelectorList>
      <DualListSelectorListItem />
    </DualListSelectorList>
  </DualListSelectorPane>
</DualListSelector>
```

### Basic


import DualListSelectorBasic from "./DualListSelectorBasic.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={DualListSelectorBasic} />

### Basic with tooltips


import DualListSelectorBasicTooltips from "./DualListSelectorBasicTooltips.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={DualListSelectorBasicTooltips} />

### Basic with search


import DualListSelectorBasicSearch from "./DualListSelectorBasicSearch.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={DualListSelectorBasicSearch} />

### Using more complex options with actions


import DualListSelectorComplexOptionsActions from "./DualListSelectorComplexOptionsActions.tsx?raw"

<LiveExample src={DualListSelectorComplexOptionsActions} />

### With tree

```ts file="DualListSelectorTree.tsx"

```

### Draggable

To enable drag and drop, wrap the `<DualListSelectorList>` component with `<DragDropSort>`, define the `variant` property as "DualListSelectorList", and pass both the sortable items and `onDrop` callback to `<DragDropSort>`. `<DragDropSort>` will create the component's usual children internally based on the items property, so children inside the `<DualListSelectorList>` should not be passed to the wrapped component.

Full drag and drop details can be found on the [drag and drop](/components/drag-and-drop) component page.

```ts file="../../../../../react-drag-drop/src/components/DragDrop/examples/DualListSelectorDraggable.tsx"

```

### Draggable with multiple drop zones

To enable multiple drop zones, wrap the `<DualListSelector>` component with `<DragDropContainer>`, and create the desired amount of `<Droppable>` components within `<DragDropContainer>`. `<Droppable>` components should be located where `<DualListSelectorList>` usually would go for each pane to be made draggable.

Each `<Droppable>` should define the `wrapper` property as the component that acts as the drop zone, `<DualListSelectorList>`, and the `items` property of their respective draggable items as an array of `<DraggableObject>` data. `<DragDropContainer>` should be passed the `onDrop`, `onContainerMove`, and `onCancel` callbacks to handle items being dropped, items moving between droppable containers, and what happens if the drag is cancelled respectively. `<DragDropContainer>` should also be given a `Record` representing all sortable drop zones' items. Both components should define the `variant` property as "DualListSelectorList".

Full drag and drop details can be found on the [drag and drop](/components/drag-and-drop) component page.

```ts file="../../../../../react-drag-drop/src/components/DragDrop/examples/DragDropContainerDualListSelector.tsx"
